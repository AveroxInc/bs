# B-Structure
I have proposed B-Structure algorithm in my MS Thesis for the faster search and insertion. This algorithm uses multiple B-Trees for this purpose. I have implemented it inside ndnSIM for the faster search and insertion of Data packets in Content-Store of a NDN node in a Wireless Sensor Network.
